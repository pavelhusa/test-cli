# Start creating Shoptet Visual Addon in a minute

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a Shoptet Visual Addon, which allows you to easily build visual addons and deploy them with a minimum of additional settings.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use create-visual-addon-boilerplate, you must have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (version 6 or higher)
You can download Node.js and npm from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

Once you have installed Node.js and npm, you can use create-visual-addon-boilerplate to create a new Visual Addon project.

## Usage
To create a new Visual Addon project, simply run the following command:
```
npx shoptet/create-visual-addon-boilerplate
```

This will launch a wizard that will guide you through the process of creating a new project. Once the wizard is complete, you will have a fully functional Visual Addon project that you can customize to your needs.

## Getting Started
To get started with your new project, simply follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
Start the development server by running `npm start`.
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your project in action.
